This is the *Customer Feedback Service* project I made myself.

Customer Feedback Service

This is a Spring Boot application that provides a REST API for managing customer feedback. It uses MongoDB as a database, which is deployed via Docker. The service supports pagination, filtering, and sorting of feedback records.
